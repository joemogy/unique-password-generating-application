## Description

Short discription

--In this repository you will find the code to a website that I built using HTML CSS and most importantly JavaScript to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they‚Äôve selected. This app will run in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The password can include special characters. If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with these, see this [list of password special characters](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters) from the OWASP Foundation.
